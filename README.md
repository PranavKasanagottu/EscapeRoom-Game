*********THE ESCAPE ROOM*********
 You are currently in a room which has a door with 3 locks.
 The only way to escape is to open all three locks and go out.
 For each lock to open you have to answer a question in three attempts.
 If you don't answer the question in three attempts you can't unlock the door and you lose.
 You can only proceed to the next question if you answer the previous question correctly.
 You may find hints or clues in the room for some questions.
 Good luck on trying to escape the room.
